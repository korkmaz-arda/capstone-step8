# Food Tray Detection: Scaling with Optical Flow


## Overview

This project scales a YOLO-based food tray detection system from static image processing to real-time video streams using Lucas-Kanade optical flow optimization.

**Models:**

- **Tray Detector**: Fine-tuned YOLO model for cafeteria trays

- **Food Detector**: YOLO11n with food classes (banana, apple, sandwich, pizza, etc.)
